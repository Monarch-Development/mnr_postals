## Monarch Postals
![mnr_postals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Monarch-Development/.github/refs/heads/main/release_images/mnr_postals.png)

After years of missing an updated and optimized resource for the category I present Monarch Postals, a resource that completes the script-side experience for postal minimaps support optimized with some ox_lib functions and reinvented for a new correct use of the resource.

## Features
- Command **/gps** to set a waypoint on a specific postal
- Notifications for postal set and postal not found
- New .lua format for postal register files to avoid json decode every call
- Better format for postal coords using `vec2`
- New grid system for a better calculation of the nearest postal
- No display of the nearest postal and added export mode to integrate it in HUDs
- Good optimization (~ 0.00-0.01ms in idle)
